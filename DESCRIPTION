Title: Confidence Interval for the Total Causal Effect under Structure Uncertainty
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Author: David Strieder [aut, cre] 
Maintainer: David Strieder <david.strieder@tum.de>
Description: Framework for constructing confidence intervals for total causal effects based on observational data that capture both types of uncertainty, the uncertainty regarding the causal structure resulting from a data-driven model selection, and uncertainty about the numerical size of the effect. Assumes linear structural equation models with partially homoscedastic Gaussian errors to ensure identifiability.
